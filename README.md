# Login application

This is a code challenge designed to practice the login process. Code was done in NodeJS and using Cypress library to execute automated test cases

**Requirements**:
* Node JS
* Cypress


Steps done to create the project:

1. Install NodeJS - This might need to be done if your computer does not have NodeJS installed yet

2. Initialize a nodeJS project

`npm init -y`

3. Install Cypress for the project

`npm install cypress --save-dev`

4. Open Cypress for the first time to create cypress.json, cypress folder structure and files (Note: this is not needed if you are going to use the files from repository)

`npx cypress open`

5. Remove the integration test cases examples

6. Install FakerJS library to generate random data

`npm install faker --save-dev`
